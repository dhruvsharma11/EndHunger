# FridgeLink

FridgeLink is a project that aims to reduce food waste and fight hunger by connecting surplus food with people in need. Our platform allows individuals and businesses to donate food to local community fridges, and provides a map of nearby community fridges where people can access free food.

## Community Fridges

Community fridges are communal refrigerators that are stocked with surplus food donations and made available to anyone in the community who needs it. They operate on the basis of trust and mutual respect, with the understanding that everyone has the right to access healthy and nutritious food.

We believe that community fridges have the potential to revolutionize the way we think about food waste and hunger. By making it easy for individuals and businesses to donate surplus food, and by providing a safe and accessible way for people in need to access that food, we can create a more equitable and sustainable food system.

## How to get Involved?

If you're interested in supporting the EndHunger project, there are several ways you can get involved:

Donate food: If you have surplus food that you'd like to donate, you can use our platform to find local charities and food banks that accept donations.

Volunteer: Community Fridges are always looking for volunteers to help with food drives, community outreach, and other initiatives. If you're interested in volunteering, please reach out to us via our website.

Spread the word: Help us raise awareness about the issue of food waste and hunger by sharing our platform with your friends and family.
